# Continuous Distributed Representation of Biological Sequences for Deep Genomics and Deep Proteomics

We introduce a new representation for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general
with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation
can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics.
